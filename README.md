🚀 Project Overview
Data Processing:       Cleaned and preprocessed raw housing data.
Feature Engineering:   Optimized data for training by handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.
Model Training:        Built a predictive model using scikit-learn and saved it as a pickle file.
Web Application:       Developed a Django-based web application to allow users to input apartment details and get price predictions.
Deployment:            Hosted the application on Render, making it accessible online.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools Used
Python:                Core language for data processing and ML model development.
Pandas & NumPy:        Data cleaning, manipulation, and feature engineering.
Scikit-Learn:          Model training and evaluation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn:  Data visualization and insights extraction.
Django:                Web framework for serving the ML model via a web interface.
Tailwind CSS:          Frontend styling for a clean UI.
Render:                Cloud platform for deployment.
